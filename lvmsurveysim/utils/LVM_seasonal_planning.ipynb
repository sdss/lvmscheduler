    "Determining and plotting observable coverage from APO and LCO\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This example note book calculates the APO and LCO observable coverage for a default set of observing modes using a combination of 0.16m telescopes at both observatories and a 1m at APO.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we include 100% observable time for M31, M33 from APO, and the LMC and SMC, the primary LVM high priority targets(HPTs). \n",
    "\n",
    "A year is broken up into a set of days. By default every day is checked. A window of +-X hours around mid-night is simulated, checking the sun-altitude, mooon phase and observability of high priority targets. If HPT is above the maximum air mass, or the moon phase is not condusive to observing a HPT, the amount of time is in the window is added to all observable windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is the sky coverage of a year possible for 15min(default) exposures, for each observatory, for each month, the total for the year, as well as the overlapping coverage of both observatories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally you can show which part of the sky is covered during bright/ HPT-high-airmass time if in a 1m campaign mode as a sperate color.\n",
