        `get_optimal_tile()` can be called repeatedly for times during that night.

        The scheduling algorithm first selects all tiles that fulfil the constraints on
        lunation, zenith distance, airmass, moon distance and shadow height.
        If there are tiles that have > 0 but less than the required visits, choose those

        If the target's tiling strategy assigns tile priorities, choose the tile with the
        hightest priority otherwise choose the one with the highest airmass.

        Parameters
        ----------
        jd : float
            The Julian Date to schedule. Must be between evening and morning twilight according
            to the observing plan.

        observed : ~numpy.array
            Same length as len(tiledb).
            Array containing the exposure time already executed for each tile in the tiledb.
            This is used to keep track of which tiles need additional time and which are completed.

            This record is kept by the caller and passed in, since an observation might fail 
            in real life. So accounting of actual observing time spent on target must be the
            responsibility of the caller.
